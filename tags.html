  <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>
    Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk,
    lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the
    other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy
    of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since
    college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she
    needed to be free.
  </p>
  <p>
    She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with
    an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
    <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
    many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama
    <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding
    achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
